        <h2>Oji waza</h2>
        <p>
        Ojiwaza are counterattack techniques.<br><br>

	To apply ojiwaza you have to initiate an attack yourself and try to force your opponent to attack when you want them to.
	The most important thing is to be prepared for making an attack before you initiate the technique.<br>
	Here are some main ojiwaza techniques. <br><br>

	Nuki waza<br><br>

	Nukiwaza are techniques where you avoid your opponent's strike by stepping to the side or moving your hands away and then striking. So there is no contact between yours and your opponent's swords.
	<br><br>

	<br><br>
	<p>
	Suriage waza<br><br>

	Is a bit similar to harai waza. The hand movement is practically the same. But the difference is that your opponent is making an attack not staying in place. Thus there is less room for mistakes.
	<br><br>
	This waza is good for learning other ojiwaza, as the hand movement is small so there is relatively a lot of time for you to execute it. It's the best for learning wrist flexibility and understanding timeing and seme oji waza.

	<br><br>
	<p>
	
	Kaeshi waza <br><br>

	It's a technique which can be described as a back with a consecutive strike. But the most important thing is that transitions between block and the cut has to be smooth. As if it was a single hand movement.

	There is a uchiotoshi waza about which I will write later.
